# YouTube Content Requests

Hello! Thank you for checking this out.

This repositories is specifically created to give you an opportunity to request for any content you'd like to see on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC16hs-fk97lq0gudiN5Ni5g).

I started this channel with the intention to create helpful content on web development. I will be focusing mostly on modern web development practices with the Jamstack. 

However, I'd like to take this a step further to ensure that I'm creating useful content for you all beautiful people.

If there's something you'd like to learn from me regarding modern web development practices, Jamstack and Vuejs, feel free to [create a new issue](https://github.com/kenny-io/YouTube-Content/issues/new) for it here.
I'll review it and give you a good feedback on when I can get it out or why I can't jump into it at the time.

You can also say hi to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kenny_io) if you'd like to chat
